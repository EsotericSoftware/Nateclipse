## Nateclipse

This Eclipse plugin improves your tabs:

* Removes the `.java` suffix so tabs are shorter.
* Removes the close button so tabs are shorter.
* Increases the number of characters for a tab to be truncated with a ellipsis to 100 so tabs are longer, but you can actually tell them apart.

It's not applied to all tabs when Eclipse loads, tabs need to be focused once. It's janky, but it works.

## Installation

Get the JAR from the [latest release](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/Nateclipse/releases) and put it in your `Eclipse/dropins` folder.
